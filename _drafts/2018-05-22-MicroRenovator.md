With more microcode patches expected in response to another Spectre variant, the difficult process of aquiring and applying firmware updates is about start over again. While microcode updates for these vulnerabilities can be delivered through either updates to UEFI firmware or Operating System packages, not all vendors have proven to be timely and thurough in distributing these updates to all platforms.

Fortunately, there's an alternative to waiting for MSFT to deploy microcode for your system, and you won't have to upgrade to Windows 10 to use it.
