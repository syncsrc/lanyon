Defending against firmware implants requires a different approach than what hardware vendors have 
traditionally provided. Firmware signatures and secure boot implementations are designed to prevent 
exploits, but don't enable detection or recovery of firmware when they inevitably fail. 

Fortunately, nearly every device has an existing mechanism to force it into a state which can be 
used to restore the writable firmware components.
